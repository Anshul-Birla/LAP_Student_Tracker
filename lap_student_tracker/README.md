This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First run `npm install` to install all depedencies

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

Go through the files in the demo repo to get a sense of how the basic project is structured. If postgres and everything is set up correctly, running npm run test should pass the only test.

## Setting up Postgres

Please follow the tutorials I sent about installing and setting up postgres. Once done, please change the default password for the user postgres to "foo".

`sudo -i -u postgres`
`psql`
`ALTER USER postgres WITH password 'foo'`

NOTE: This is for people who do not have an empty password for their default postgres. If an empty password works, change the enviroment variable in .env.local to the empty string.
